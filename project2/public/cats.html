                        cats, has been analogized to that of human fashion models. Personality-wise, the cats
                        traditionally display active, curious attitudes in which they frequently follow owners around
                        and encourage play.Their dog-like characteristics also involve a particular sense of
                        affection and desire for interaction. Abys have a distinctive wildcat look with their ticked
                        coat and large erect ears.
